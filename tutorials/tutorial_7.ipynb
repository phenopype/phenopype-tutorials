    "# Tutorial 7: Video analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The principles of video analysis and image analysis are similar: instead of images, single video frames are segmented into foreground and background, and the extracted information is processed after all frames have been analyzed (e.g. frame-wise location is converted into trajectories). However, a big advantage is that differences among consecutive frames can be used to train a background model from which the foreground can segmented. This is called foreground-background subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the tracking module works standalone and uses only few routines of the phenopype core modules. Future releases may feature a better integration with the different phenopype workflows.  "

Should the `video_ouput` method be called then it will save an output video with similar properties (codec, dimensions, fps.) of the input file.    "

    "Consecutive masking needs to be activated in the detection settings (`c_mask=True`). This option will prohibit repeated detection of objects when several tracking methods are applied. For example, inside the detected fish-area sometimes isopod objects are detected, due to artifacts or incomplete subtraction results. Consecutive masking will \"block\" an area after the first method has been applied - the order by which methods are applied matters. The following settings will create a mask around the fish (which is detected first) in the shape of a rectangle + pixels around the detected contour. "

    "If we are happy with the tracking results, we can save and analyze them in Python, R, or elsewhere. Then next step would be to assign particles to a trajectory, so we can investigate the behavior of isopods in the presence of fish. An efficient option in Python is the `trackpy` library, which is good at filtering and calculating trajectories. [Example 4](example_4_video_analysis_stickleback.ipynb) provides an example workflow for `phenopype` with `trackpy`."
