    "Analysis of scientific images can be an iterative process that may require users to go back and forth, trying different processing steps and check how to improve results. Later, when the best functions and appropriate settings are found and efficient data collection has priority, image analysis should be efficient and with minimal user input to increase throughput and reproducibility. In phenopype, users can choose between two different workflows that are useful for different stages in the process of scientific image analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Workflow | Use case | Operation principle | Code explicitness | Data reproducibility |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "| **Low throughput** | \"prototyping\" - self education and evaluation on single images and small datasets | image analysis functions are written and stored in Python | high | low |\n",
    "| **High throughput**  | \"production\" - default workflow for larger image datasets | images analysis functions are written and stored in YAML format | low | high |\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **low throughput** workflow, users write a function stack in directly in Python code. This is recommended for users who wish to familiarize themselves with the basic principles of computer vision or when working with only a handful of images. In contrast, the **high throughput** workflow is for production stage, when image analysis should be efficient and data collection reproducible for other users and scientists. In this tutorial you will learn about the differences between the two workflows."

First we need to draw a mask around posterior region that contains the plates. For that step you should select the boundaries around the area of interest, perform a thresholding operation inside the mask, and retrieve the contours inside. The procedure to extract bone-plate area is the same in all workflows, but workflows differ in the amount of explicit Python code, and in reproducibility. "
