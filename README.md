phenopype tutorials
===================

Instructions
------------

(From https://phenopype.org/docs/tutorials)

The tutorials are written as `jupyter notebooks` - browser based Python kernels to run, document, and visualize code (https://jupyter.org/). If you installed Python using Anaconda, it is possible that `jupyter` is already installed (check with `jupyter --version`). 

1. Install phenopype (see https://phenopype.org/docs/installation) and jupyter notebook (`pip install jupyter notebook`)
2. [Download](https://github.com/phenopype/phenopype-tutorials/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unpack this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the unpacked phenopype repository.
4. Start the notebooks with `jupyter notebook` and click on one of the tutorial files.
5. Run the code cell by cell

Make sure you install jupyter notebook to your specific environment (i.e. activate it first using `conda activate "pp"`. If it is not installed in a specific environment, running `jupyter notebook` will fall back on the conda base environment where phenopype may not be installed (this is a common source of confusion).
